feat: Implement Phase 2 resource systems (HP, Coins, Mana)

Added core resource tracking to enable roguelike gameplay loop:

- HP System: Players start with 3 HP, take -1 HP per mine hit, game over at 0 HP (replaces instant death)
- Coin Generation: +10 coins per safe cell revealed (including cascade reveals)
- Mana System: +5 mana per cell revealed, +10 mana per flag placed (capped at 100)
- HUD Updates: Real-time display updates for all resource changes

Resource tracking works across all input methods:
- Mouse: Left-click reveal, right-click flag
- Touch: Tap reveal, long-press flag
- Keyboard: Space reveal, F flag, C chord

Implementation:
- Followed Analysis → Research → Plan → Implement workflow
- Used 3 parallel agents for implementation
- HP damage replaces instant game over (players can survive 3 mine hits)
- Cascade counting tracks grid.revealed before/after for accurate rewards
- Flag mana bonus only on placement (not removal)
- updateHUD() called after every resource change (16 call sites)

Changes:
- src/main.js: Added resource tracking to all event handlers (mouse, touch, keyboard)
- src/main.js: Updated game over logic to trigger only at 0 HP
- src/main.js: Integrated updateHUD() calls for reactive display
- PROGRESS.md: Added Phase 2 section with implementation details
- SESSION_SUMMARY_phase2-implementation.md: Complete session documentation

Testing:
- Code validation passed (warnings only, intentional)
- Manual testing in progress
- Server running at http://localhost:8000
- All test cases defined in PLAN_phase2-resources.md
