## 🗑️ Why Archive?

Files are archived when they meet ALL of these criteria:

1. **Feature Complete**: The feature is fully implemented and tested
2. **Documentation Served Purpose**: The docs were created to guide implementation
3. **No Longer Referenced**: Not needed for ongoing development
4. **Historical Value**: Worth keeping for reference or audit trail

---

## 📖 When to Reference Archive

You might reference archived docs when:

- Understanding why certain implementation decisions were made
- Debugging issues related to archived features
- Creating similar features in the future
- Onboarding new developers
- Writing postmortems or retrospectives

---

## 🔄 Archive Maintenance

**Do NOT delete archived files** - they provide valuable context and history.

If you need to reference archived documentation frequently, it might indicate the file should be moved back to active docs or the information should be integrated into core documentation.
